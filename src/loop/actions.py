"""Action executors — read, search, bind, analyze, verify.

Each executor is a bounded job for a cheap model: it receives exactly the
state slice it needs and writes claims back to the board. Workers may
propose new targets freely (discovery must never ask permission); the
ledger maintenance pass grooms proposals later.

Bind is an LLM call by design: mapping claims to targets is semantic
work, and rules would smuggle domain assumptions into the architecture.

Obligations that documents impose on parties (notice duties, filing duties, contractual obligations of the insured/permittee/borrower) are "observation", NEVER "requirement".
- Be exhaustive on facts relevant to the questions; include other clearly material facts too.
- Dense term-bearing text (policy declarations, schedules, fee tables, defined-term lists) demands EVERY term: every limit, sublimit, deductible, retention, date, exclusion, endorsement, and amount — completeness over brevity.
- proposed_targets only for genuinely new material questions, not restatements. A target must be a QUESTION answerable from the sources or web search — advice or actions for the client ("negotiate X", "obtain Y") are claims (recommendation/gap), never targets.
- evidence must be copied verbatim from the document. It is used to locate the source span; do not paraphrase it.
- proposed_reads are for explicit cross-references or clearly missing referenced materials, e.g. "Section 8.3", "Exhibit B", "Schedule 2.1". Do not propose generic extra research.
- proposed_reads should be few and high-value; omit them if no specific referenced source/section is visible."""
