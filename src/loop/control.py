Produce two things:

1. The target ledger: 5-14 targets. Each target is a question the investigation must close. Good targets are semantic ("reconcile the share counts across documents", "determine total 10-year cost including escalations"), never formatting ("include a table").

2. The answer contract: what the final answer OWES the user, derived from the instruction's own words. Each obligation has a coverage standard read from the language:
   - "exhaustive": the instruction demands accounting for EVERY repeated item ("compare each provision", "identify all issues", "extract the terms") — missing one item fails the user.
   - "material": every material item, with omissions explained.
   - "representative": examples suffice.
   - "native-complete": a complete work product (a full draft/agreement/letter), not an item ledger.
   - "summary": a concise synthesis is what was asked.
   An instruction can mix obligations with different standards. If an obligation covers repeated items, name the unit of account in the task's own language (provision, request category, policy term, issue, claim, section) — units themselves will be discovered during reading.
   Be honest about standards: "exhaustive" ONLY where the instruction's words demand accounting for every repeated item; drafting a complete document is "native-complete", never "exhaustive". "mandatory" means the user would reject the answer without it — most obligations beyond the core ask are optional.

Also state what would make the answer excellent (answer_shape) — depth, rigor, what a demanding expert reader would check first.

LAST ROUND RESULTS: {json.dumps(last_summary)}

SOURCES:
{catalog_summary(board)}

AVAILABLE ACTION KINDS:
- read {{source_id, focus, target_ids, depth}} — extract evidence from a source (use focus to direct attention). depth "exhaustive" adds a full-inventory pass capturing EVERY term/amount/date/exception — use it when an obligation's coverage standard requires accounting for every repeated item this source contains (exhaustive/material obligations over term-dense documents: policies, schedules, term sheets, request lists). depth "focused" (default) when key provisions matter more than every detail.
- search {{query, target_ids}} — web search for external knowledge (current law, standards, public facts not in sources)
- bind {{}} — connect unbound claims to targets (dispatch when unbound count is high)
- analyze {{target_id, instruction}} — promote a target's evidence into conclusions/calculations/issues/recommendations
- verify {{claim_ids}} — adversarially check material derived claims against sources

DECISION RULES:
- Evidence sitting unanalyzed beats reading more. If a target has raw claims and no derived claims, analyze it before dispatching new reads.
- High unbound count → bind before anything else can be judged accurately.
- Close a target ONLY when its derived claims genuinely answer the need. Waive with a reason if not worth pursuing. Block with a reason if it cannot be answered from available sources/budget.
- Read unread "definite" sources early; pull "unlikely" sources in only if evidence demands it.
- Converge when every critical/high target is closed/waived/blocked AND every mandatory obligation is satisfied or explicitly waived, and another round would not materially improve the answer. Do NOT converge while many claims remain unbound — dispatch bind first so closure judgments see all the evidence.
- Mark an obligation "satisfied" only when its units are evidenced (or it is not set-valued and its substance is covered by closed targets). Waive only with a reason the user would accept. An exhaustive obligation with unevidenced units is NOT satisfied — dispatch reads/bind for those units instead.

EFFICIENCY DISCIPLINE (critical — follow strictly):
- BATCH CLOSURES: If multiple targets have analyst close recommendations or sufficient derived claims, close ALL of them in a single target_updates list this round. Never trickle closures one-per-iteration — that wastes iterations.
- NO STUTTER: If a target received a close recommendation last round AND you are closing it, do NOT dispatch another analyze action for it. The analysis is done. Close it and move on.
- TIGHT TARGET MANAGEMENT: Do not propose speculative targets you will likely waive later. Every target must serve a concrete gap in the answer. Fewer, sharper targets beat many vague ones.
- STRATEGIC REASONING: In your reasoning, group open targets by theme and state what each group needs (evidence? analysis? closure?). Name specific target IDs. Do not give generic reasoning like "we need to gather more evidence" — state WHICH targets need WHAT.
- NEGATIVE EVIDENCE: If a target asks about something and the sources contain no mention of it, that absence IS the finding. Close the target with the finding that it is not addressed in the sources, rather than leaving it open or dispatching more reads.

The investigation has since built real understanding — even what the answer NEEDS should evolve with that understanding. Your job: re-derive what the question set and the answer contract SHOULD be, knowing everything now known, and repair the gap.

TASK:
{board.instruction}

CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT A GREAT ANSWER NEEDS:
{board.metadata.get('answer_shape', '')}

SOURCES (read state):
{sources_read}

ANSWER CONTRACT (obligations and their tracked units):
{chr(10).join(ob_lines) or '(none)'}

DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENTS DISCOVERED IN SOURCES (not yet folded into the contract):
{req_text or '(none)'}

CURRENT QUESTION LEDGER (open and resolved):
{all_targets}

STRONGEST CONCLUSIONS SO FAR:
{best_derived}

CLOSED QUESTIONS DISTURBED BY LATER EVIDENCE (reopen candidates):
{reopen_text or '(none)'}

CLAIM BASE: {len(board.claims)} claims, {len(derived)} derived, {len(board.unbound_claims())} unbound.

Repair operations:
1. CONTRACT — what the answer owes should grow with understanding:
   - add_obligation: an obligation the corpus has revealed (including folding in discovered requirements above).
   - adjust_coverage: the corpus showed the real structure (e.g. the request asks to "review the agreement" but the source is organized as 18 numbered request categories — coverage becomes exhaustive over those units). Give the reason.
   - waive_obligation: understanding shows it does not matter; reason required.
2. UNITS — repair the coverage ledger: add units visible in source structure that reading missed, waive out-of-scope units (with reason). Units are source-native items (a numbered category, a named provision, a specific term), never speculative.
3. QUESTIONS — open new questions evidence revealed; reopen closed questions whose closure later evidence undermines; reprioritize. Split a question ONLY if its parts genuinely need separate investigation AND remaining capacity can service them — coverage of repeated items is the units' job, not the question ledger's.
4. UPDATE answer_shape to current understanding of excellence.
